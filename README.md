# -Voice-Controlled-Smart-Wheelchair-Using-Arduino-and-Bluetooth

Short Summary : Made a prototype for a voice controlled wheelchair using Arduino. An app was made to 
provide an interface for the user for giving commands. Automatic detection of obstacles and 
alarm systems were also added.



This project was conceived as an idea to ease the lives of those among
us who are unfortunate enough to have lost the ability to move their legs
due to a significant amount of paralysis, accident or due to old age. A
disabled person require a wheelchair to perform functions that require
him/her to move around. Caretakers will not always able to actively
monitor disabled individuals. The disabled person need a way to control
their wheelchair that meets their specific needs.

A smart, motorized, voice controlled wheelchair will differently abled
persons to control a wheelchair without the help of anyone. A voice
activation system is an additional perk. It makes life easier for them. They
can give voice commands to control the movements of the wheelchair.
The voice command is given through a cellular device having Bluetooth
and the command is transferred through the Bluetooth Module HC-05
connected to the Arduino board.

Ultrasonic sensor is also made a part of the design. It helps to detect
obstacles lying ahead in the way of the wheelchair that can hinder the
passage of the wheelchair. The sensor will give signals to Arduino which
will give instructions to stop the wheelchair. This will make their life
independent and easy. A buzzer can also be provided. In case of any
emergencies he/she can press it so that they can be helped.
